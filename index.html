          "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance/ The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that not utorial could ever have. In fact, i've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          deceloper after receicing multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
